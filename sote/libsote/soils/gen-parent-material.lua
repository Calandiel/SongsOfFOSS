--* Okay so... Mineral need to have a quantity relative to the total mass of the soil. So theoretically it should be represented as a percentage. Initially
--* when we first weather away the parent material it can be expressed as 0 - 100 percent. Basalts will be super high where as quartz will be super low...
--* Then the mineral nutrient value get transported with the sediment load... Let's see if we can get this first part done correctly first!

--* Plan for soil creation ///
--* ---First, we create some local resolution biases in generation of silt, sand, clay. Then we will evaluate each tile, apply the biases, and then based on the bias and
--* bedrock type we will produce a specific quantity of sand, silt, and clay. We'll need a number of factors influencing this production. Some silt will be produced by glacial action,
--* either historic or current, some production of sand, silt, and clay will be the result of alluvial weathering, some silt will be produced as a result of the decomposition,
--* of organics into 2 micrometer humus particles, and some sand, silt, and clay will result from "other" weathering causes (seasonal temperature changes, etc).
--* ---Once we have this "mass" of material, we will then transport it either by wind or water. In effect, some tiles will have material which is mostly native, aka,
--* the material was produced by local bedrock weathering. However, some locations will be dominated by subsidies of material, such as Leoss soils and alluvial soils
--* along river banks. Some locations will be a mix.
--* We then either create 3 byte sized variables for a tile's soil texture (silt, sand and clay) or we simply create an enumeration for the 16 or so soil texture categories.
--* 


--* Immediate plan... for silt production ///
--* We can generate water flow silt first... but its tricky.
--* Select tiles which were glaciated but current are not. The colder they are, the less silt they should end up getting cause they were "unglaciated" for less time.
--* Generate silt to be "drained". Then we drain it. We don't need to be concerned at this point about sediment load capacity because we're dealing with glacial melt.
--* So just run a trunkated version of our rainfall algorithm, with no repeats. Terminate as soon as silt reaches any kind of waterbody. Then add that silt to the waterbody.
--* Then we'll probably want to transfer that sediment load downstream afterward so that we understand how much silt is passed downstream.
--* We will reserve flooding for AFTER we determine other sediment load from bedrock weathering and transport



--* AUXILLIARY Plan for non-bedrock weathering Silt Production ///
--* ---Can be produced from glacial activity. Some is blown around from maximum and minimum extent of ice sheets. Some flows via rivers.
--* Will be based on the bedrock material that was ground up.
--* ---Can be produced from winds blowing across deserts. Age of desert matters, will be dispersed by winds in all directions.
--* ---Can be produced from water flow. As water flows down river, large particles are broken up and become silt sized
--* DONE ---Can be produced from volcanic ash, and is blown around the surrounding area
--* ---We need to run a loop for wind blown siltation sources. First we do it for glaciers and ice sheets. Then we do it for sand dunes. Then we do it for volcanoes. Each time
--* we record how much silt and mineral nutrient is generated in the tile. Then we blow it everywhere.
