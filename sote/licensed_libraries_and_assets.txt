LGPL 2.1
					  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
						   Version 2.1, February 1999

	 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

	[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
	 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
	 the version number 2.1.]

								Preamble

	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
	Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
	free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

	  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
	specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
	Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
	can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
	this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
	strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
	not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
	you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
	for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
	it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
	it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
	these things.

	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
	distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
	rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
	you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

	  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
	or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
	you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
	code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
	complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
	with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
	it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

	  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
	library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
	permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

	  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
	there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
	modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
	that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
	author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
	introduced by others.

	  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
	any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
	effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
	restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
	any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
	consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

	  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
	ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
	General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
	is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
	this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
	libraries into non-free programs.

	  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
	a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
	combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
	General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
	entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
	Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
	the library.

	  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
	does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
	Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
	of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
	are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
	libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
	special circumstances.

	  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
	encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
	a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
	allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
	library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
	case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
	software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

	  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
	programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
	free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
	non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
	operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
	system.

	  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
	users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
	linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
	that program using a modified version of the Library.

	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
	"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
	former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
	be combined with the library in order to run.

					  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
	program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
	other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
	this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
	Each licensee is addressed as "you".

	  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
	prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
	(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

	  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
	which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
	Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
	copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
	portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
	straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
	included without limitation in the term "modification".)

	  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
	all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
	interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
	and installation of the library.

	  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
	such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
	on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
	writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
	and what the program that uses the Library does.

	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
	complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
	you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
	appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
	all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
	warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
	Library.

	  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
	and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
	fee.

	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

		a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

		b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
		stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

		c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
		charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

		d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
		table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
		the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
		is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
		in the event an application does not supply such function or
		table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
		its purpose remains meaningful.

		(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
		a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
		application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
		application-supplied function or table used by this function must
		be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
		root function must still compute square roots.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
	it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	collective works based on the Library.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
	with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	the scope of this License.

	  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
	License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
	this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
	that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
	instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
	ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
	that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
	these notices.

	  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
	that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
	subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

	  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
	the Library into a program that is not a library.

	  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
	derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
	under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
	it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
	must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
	medium customarily used for software interchange.

	  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
	from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
	source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
	distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

	  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
	Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
	linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
	work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
	therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

	  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
	creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
	contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
	library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
	Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

	  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
	that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
	derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
	Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
	linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
	threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

	  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
	structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
	functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
	file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
	work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
	Library will still fall under Section 6.)

	  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
	distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
	Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
	whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

	  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
	link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
	work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
	under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
	modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
	engineering for debugging such modifications.

	  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
	Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
	this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
	during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
	copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
	directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
	of these things:

		a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
		machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
		changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
		Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
		with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
		uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
		user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
		executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
		that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
		Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
		to use the modified definitions.)

		b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
		Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
		copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
		rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
		will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
		the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
		interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

		c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
		least three years, to give the same user the materials
		specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
		than the cost of performing this distribution.

		d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
		from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
		specified materials from the same place.

		e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
		materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

	  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
	Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
	reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
	the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
	normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
	components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
	which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
	the executable.

	  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
	restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
	accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
	use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
	distribute.

	  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
	Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
	facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
	library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
	the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
	permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

		a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
		based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
		facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
		Sections above.

		b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
		that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
		where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

	  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
	the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
	attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
	distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
	rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
	or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
	terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

	  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
	Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Library or works based on it.

	  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
	Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
	subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
	this License.

	  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
	particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
	and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.

	  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
	an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
	so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
	excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
	written in the body of this License.

	  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
	versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
	Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
	but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
	"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
	conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
	the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
	license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
	the Free Software Foundation.

	  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
	write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
	copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
	Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
	decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
	of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
	and reuse of software generally.

								NO WARRANTY

	  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
	WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
	EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
	OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
	KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
	IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
	LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
	THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

	  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
	WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
	AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
	FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
	CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
	LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
	RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
	FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
	SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
	DAMAGES.

						 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

			   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

	  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
	possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
	everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
	redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
	ordinary General Public License).

	  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
	safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
	convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
	"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

		<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
		Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

		This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
		modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
		License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
		version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

		This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
		but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
		MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
		Lesser General Public License for more details.

		You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
		License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
		Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
	school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
	necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

	  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
	  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

GPL 2
						GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
						   Version 2, June 1991

	 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
	 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

								Preamble

	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
	License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
	software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
	General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
	Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
	using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
	the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
	your programs, too.

	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
	if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
	in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
	anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
	These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
	distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

	  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
	gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
	you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
	source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
	rights.

	  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
	(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
	distribute and/or modify the software.

	  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
	that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
	software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
	want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
	that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
	authors' reputations.

	  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
	patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
	program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
	program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
	patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.

						GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
	a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
	under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
	refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
	means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
	that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
	either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
	language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
	the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
	is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
	Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
	Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
	source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
	conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
	copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
	notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
	and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
	along with the Program.

	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
	you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

		a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
		stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

		b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
		whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
		part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
		parties under the terms of this License.

		c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
		when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
		interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
		announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
		notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
		a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
		these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
		License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
		does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
		the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	collective works based on the Program.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
	with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	the scope of this License.

	  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
	under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
	Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

		a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
		source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
		1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

		b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
		years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
		cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
		machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
		distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
		customarily used for software interchange; or,

		c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
		to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
		allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
		received the program in object code or executable form with such
		an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
	code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
	associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
	control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
	special exception, the source code distributed need not include
	anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
	form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
	operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
	itself accompanies the executable.

	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
	access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
	access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
	distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

	  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
	except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
	otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
	void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
	However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
	this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
	parties remain in full compliance.

	  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Program or works based on it.

	  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
	these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
	this License.

	  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
	any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
	apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
	circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.

	  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
	those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
	countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
	the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

	  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
	address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
	later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
	either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
	Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
	this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
	Foundation.

	  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
	to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
	Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
	make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
	of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
	of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

								NO WARRANTY

	  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
	FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
	OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
	PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
	OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
	TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
	REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

	  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
	REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
	TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
	YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

						 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

				How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

	  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

	  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
	convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

		<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
		Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

		This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
		it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
		the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
		(at your option) any later version.

		This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
		but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
		MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
		GNU General Public License for more details.

		You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
		with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
		51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

	If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
	when it starts in an interactive mode:

		Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
		Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
		This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
		under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

	The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
	parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
	be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
	mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
	school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
	necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

	  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
	  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

	  Ty Coon, President of Vice

	This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
	proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
	consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
	library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
	Public License instead of this License.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
    "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
    "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
    "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
    "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
    "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
    to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

    For the avoidance of doubt:
        Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
        Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
        Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
