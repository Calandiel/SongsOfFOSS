# SongsOfGPL

A FOSS release of source code of the unreleased version 0.3 of Songs of the Eons.
Released with permission of the project owner.
Note that this release includes only the unfinished Lua reimplementation on a square tile world.
The 0.2 release relies critically on code that cannot be licensed under GPL and has contributions from people we can't reach anymore. That being said, this codebase still includes some potentially interesting features, such as the climate, vegetation and biome models.
Keep in mind that this build is unfinished and likely won't be worked on in the foreseeable future (though, I will review and merge in any potential merge requests that may come its way).
